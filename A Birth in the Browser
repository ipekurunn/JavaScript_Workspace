A Birth in the Browser

Our story begins in the mid-'90s, a time when the web was taking its first baby steps. In 1995, Netscape Communications, a pioneer in web browsers, unveiled something revolutionary: Netscape Navigator 2.0. This browser introduced JavaScript, a scripting language that could bring life to static web pages.

Now, here's the fun part â€“ JavaScript was initially codenamed "Mocha," and later, "LiveScript." In a surprising turn of events, Netscape decided to team up with the software giant Sun Microsystems, and that's when "JavaScript" was officially baptized. The name was undoubtedly influenced by the popularity of Java at the time, although the two languages are quite different.

The Browser Wars
The late '90s witnessed a fierce competition between web browsers, known as the "Browser Wars." Microsoft introduced Internet Explorer (IE), which sparked a battle for web dominance. In this intense rivalry, JavaScript became a vital weapon, as web developers utilized its capabilities to create interactive content.

ECMAScript Standardization
With JavaScript's growing popularity, standardization became crucial. Enter ECMAScript! This organization, founded in 1996, is responsible for defining the standard specifications for JavaScript. The first edition of ECMAScript was published in 1997, providing a foundation for JavaScript's consistent development across different browsers.
