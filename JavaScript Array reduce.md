# Introduction to the JavaScript Array reduce() method
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let sum = numbers.reduce(function (accumulator, currentValue) {
    return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);
```
The reduce() method accepts a function that takes two parameters. The first parameter is an accumulator value that is updated during the process, and the second parameter is the current item (currentValue).

Initially, the accumulator value starts at 0. This is the starting value that will hold the total.

As the function processes each element, it adds the current element to the accumulator value. In the first step, the accumulator value is 0 and the current element is 1, so the total is 1.

In the second step, the accumulator value becomes 1, which is the sum calculated in the previous step, and the current item is 2. So the total becomes 1 + 2 = 3.

This process is repeated for each item, eventually totaling 15. That is, the sum variable takes the value 15.

As a result, the reduce() method is used to process an array of elements and combine these elements together to produce a single result.
